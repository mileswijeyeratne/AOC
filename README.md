# My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

I first took part in 2022 as a way to improve and only managed to complete 37 stars. During 2023 I went and completed older problems from time to time. For 2023 I was more competitive managing to complete all 50 stars for the first time.

Code in this repo was written at different times thus will be very unstandardised. Also, I only recently found my 2022 solutions (the first I ever did) so they are just thrown into the 2022 folder. 

## Details
- 2023 uses [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) to download input
- To run days:
    - paste a session cookie into ```session.txt```
    - navigate to the correct dir and run a day with ```python <filename.py> <part> <optional test>``` in cmd. For example: ```python 25.py a -t``` to run day 25 part a on the test data or ```python 16.py b``` to run day 16 part b on the full input.
